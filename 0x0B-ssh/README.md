SSH, or Secure Shell, is a network protocol used for securely connecting to a remote server or computer. It provides an encrypted communication channel between two systems and allows users to securely log in and execute commands on the remote system.

How SSH works
SSH works by creating a secure, encrypted communication channel between the client (local computer) and the server (remote computer). The encryption process uses a public key cryptography system to authenticate the identity of the remote server and ensure that the communication between the two systems is secure.

When a user attempts to connect to a remote server using SSH, the client sends a request to the server to initiate the connection. The server responds by sending its public key to the client. The client then uses the server's public key to encrypt a random message and sends it back to the server. If the server is able to decrypt the message using its private key, the client is authenticated and the secure communication channel is established.
